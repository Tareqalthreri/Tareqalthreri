## 🏁 About Me
I'm a developer building my skills step-by-step with a focus on strong fundamentals and high-quality code.

- Learning **C++** and strengthening my problem-solving foundation.  
- Preparing to move into **C#** for desktop application development.  
- Studying **Database fundamentals** (SQL, modeling, relational concepts).  
- Obsessed with **algorithmic thinking** and writing clean, maintainable code.
